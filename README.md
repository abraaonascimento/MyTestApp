# Real-Time-Traffic-Application

## In development

I'm developing a cool Traffic-Application to show the traffic public transport in SÃ£o Paulo city. 
It have been excited to me because I use public transport every single day. So, I can for my own, 
build something that show to me how the traffic works. 

Maybe it can be helpul for someone too. 

It image below is a little simple sample about what I will built first
