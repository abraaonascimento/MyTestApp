# Real-Time-Traffic-Application

## In development

I'm developing a cool Traffic-Application to show the traffic public transport in SÃ£o Paulo city. 
It have been excited to me because I use public transport every single day. So It's very nice 
to can for my own to build something that show how the traffic works. 

Maybe it can be helpul for someone too. 

It image below is a little simple sample about what I will built first
